<h1>CREATE CV</h1>



<h2>REFLECTION WITH STAR TECHNIQUE</h2>
<br>
Situation:
I recently completed a tutorial on how to create a professional CV. It included a short quiz that tested my understanding of the different sections of a CV, like work experience, education, and skills, and their specific purposes.
<br/>

<br>
Task:
My goal was to learn how to structure a CV effectively and understand what kind of information to include in each section. I wanted to be able to present my experience and abilities in a way that makes a strong impression on potential employers.
<br />

<br>
Action:
 I learned that the primary purpose of a CV is to showcase my qualifications and convince employers that I’m a good fit for a position. The tutorial explained that the work experience section should highlight relevant roles and responsibilities, and should be listed in reverse chronological order, starting with the most recent position.

In the skills section, I found out it’s important to include both technical and soft skills that are relevant to the job I’m applying for. I also learned that the education section should focus on the highest level of education achieved, including qualifications, dates, and institutions, especially if they’re relevant to the role.

I took the quiz after  to test my understanding and, even though I initially got the first question wrong, I used the feedback to correct my thinking and went on to answer the rest correctly.

<br>
Result:
By the end of the tutorial, I had a clearer picture of how my personality traits could guide my choices. I saw that I lean toward [insert your personality type, if known], which helps explain why I enjoy certain tasks more than others. This understanding will help me make better decisions when it comes to choosing subjects, applying for jobs, or even deciding what kind of team or work environment I’d thrive in. The tutorial gave me a new perspective—not just on what I can do, but on what I’m more likely to enjoy doing over the long term.
